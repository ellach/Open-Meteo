# Open-Meteo

The project consists of two pages: index.html which contains a button that navigates to the main work (forecast.html) and a brief explanation.
The main page presents two dependent location models fetched from the WeatherAPI: rain and temperature.
By selecting a location, we fetch data such as latitude and longitude.
Then, based on this data, we fetch the temperature and rain information for that location for one day.

Instructions for Data Presentation:

1) Select a location.</br>
2) Choose the time for which you wish to see the data.</br>

Usage:

You can download the ZIP file to your computer and run it by clicking on the index.html file.
